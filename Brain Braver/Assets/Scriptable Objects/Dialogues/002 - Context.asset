  - 'Good job. And yes, you heard that right. You are in your own brain. '
  - I've explained this before the operation, but I'm afraid your long-term memory
    might have been compromised.
  - You suffer from an aggressive brain tumor. We tried operating via nanites, but
    it seems the tumor broke them.
  - With no other options, you have volunteered to experiment with the BRAVER (Brain-Reaching
    Action Vehicle).
  - 'I am the overseer of the project and your handler in this operation. '
  - Up ahead there is a tumor cell. Hop on the vein and destroy it with the blaster.
