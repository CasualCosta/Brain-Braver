  - Pilot, I can no longer see you. It seems the tumor has destroyed our tracking
    probe.
  - There is little to worry, though. From where I last saw you, you were somewhat
    near the main tumor.
  - Once you are done, our brain analysis probe will detect that the tumor has been
    destroyed and we will wake you up.
  - You will have to take the second turn on the right once you reach the main junction.
  - Once you get there, destroy the tumor so we can wake you up.
